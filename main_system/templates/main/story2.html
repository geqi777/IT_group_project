                <p class="lead">Ceramics is an ancient and ever-evolving art form. From practical utensils to artistic expressions, ceramics continue to evolve in contemporary society, blending traditional techniques with modern aesthetics.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">From Traditional to Modern</h3>
                <p>Ceramics has a long history in China, dating back to the Neolithic era with painted pottery. Over thousands of years, Chinese ceramic craftsmanship has developed, creating styles such as celadon, white porcelain, and blue and white porcelain, each dynasty having its unique ceramic art characteristics.</p>
                
                <p>In the 20th century, global ceramics began to shift from traditional practical utensils to artistic expressions. Ceramic artists started exploring new forms, textures, and glazes, breaking the traditional notion that ceramics must be practical. This shift not only expanded the expressive power of ceramics but also made it an important part of modern art.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Characteristics of Contemporary Ceramics</h3>
                <p>Modern ceramics have the following notable characteristics:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diversity</strong>: Integrating different cultures, materials, and techniques, breaking traditional boundaries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Experimentation</strong>: Exploring new glazes, firing methods, and surface treatment techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conceptuality</strong>: Ceramics are not only a material form but also a carrier of thoughts and emotions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interdisciplinarity</strong>: Combining with sculpture, installation art, architecture, and other fields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Expression</strong>: Emphasizing the artist's personal style and creative ideas.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">Technology and Innovation</h3>
                <p>The development of modern technology has also brought new possibilities to ceramics. 3D printing technology allows ceramic artists to create complex structures that are difficult to achieve by hand; digital modeling software helps artists design and simulate the effects of their works in advance; the development of new glazes and materials provides richer color and texture choices for works.</p>
                
                <p>At the same time, many ceramic artists are also re-examining traditional techniques, combining ancient pottery methods with modern design concepts to create works that have both historical heritage and contemporary aesthetics. This innovative inheritance of tradition is an important direction for the development of modern ceramics.</p>
