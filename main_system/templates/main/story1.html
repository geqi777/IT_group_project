                <h3 class="mt-4">History of Weaving</h3>
                <p>Weaving is one of the oldest crafts of humanity, dating back to the Neolithic era. Initially, humans used plant fibers and animal hair to weave simple baskets and clothing. Over time, weaving techniques gradually developed into a refined and complex art form.</p>
                
                <p>In China, the art of weaving has a history of thousands of years. From Han dynasty silk fabrics to Song dynasty bamboo weaving, weaving holds an important place in traditional Chinese culture. Each region has its unique weaving styles and techniques, reflecting local cultural characteristics and natural environments.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">Revival of Modern Hand Weaving</h3>
                <p>In recent years, with the renewed focus on sustainable lifestyles and traditional crafts, hand weaving is experiencing a revival. More and more young people are learning weaving techniques, combining traditional elements with modern designs to create unique and fashionable products.</p>
                
                <p>At Unicraft, we collaborate with traditional artisans from various regions of China to create woven works that blend ancient techniques with modern aesthetics. We believe that through this approach, we can not only protect these precious cultural heritages but also provide contemporary consumers with unique, high-quality handicrafts.</p>

                <p>Traditional hand weaving is a process that requires patience and skill, usually involving the following steps:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Material Preparation</strong>: Selecting and processing suitable materials such as bamboo, grass, rattan, or yarn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design Concept</strong>: Planning the shape and pattern of the woven work based on traditional designs or innovative ideas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic Structure Weaving</strong>: First weaving the basic framework or structure of the item.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern Weaving</strong>: Adding intricate patterns and decorations to the basic structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Detail Refinement</strong>: Finishing the work, ensuring every detail is precise and perfect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surface Treatment</strong>: Applying paint, dye, or other surface treatments as needed.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Each step requires the artisans' meticulous operation and rich experience. A high-quality hand-woven piece may take several days or even weeks to complete.</p>
